# Heel

Knit across the front needle. You will now be working only on the back needle.

## Heel Flap

Row 1: *SL1p, k1* Repeat ** to end.

Row 2: SL1p, p to end.

Repeat [Rows 1 & 2] 13 (15, 17) more times or until desired height of heel flap. A taller flap may be preferred for people with high arches.

## Heel turn

Row 1: Knit 15 (17, 19) stitches, ssk, k1, turn.

Row 2: SL1p wyif, p3, p2tog, p1, turn.

Row 3: SL1p wyib, knit to 1 stitch before the gap created by the turn, ssk, k1, turn.

Row 4: SL1p wyif, purl to 1 stitch before the gap created by the turn, p2tog, p1, turn.

Repeat [Rows 3 & 4] until all heel stitches are worked. (16 (18, 20) stitches remaining)

## Pick Up Stitches

Knit across the heel stitches, placing a marker at the center to mark the new beginning of round.

Pick-up and knit each edge stitch (14 (16, 18) stitches or half the number of rows you worked for the heel flap). place a marker for gusset decreases.

Knit the 29 (33, 37) front stitches. Place a marker for gusset decreases.

Pick-up and knit each edge stitch (14 (16, 18) stitches or half the number of rows you worked for the heel flap).

Knit to the beginning of round marker. 

Redistribute your stitches as needed. I find it easiest to have gusset and heel stitches on one needle and the lace top stitches on the other, but this can be a bit awkward at the beginning. 

In this configuration, you will have 29 (33, 37) stitches on the front needle and 44 (50, 56) stitches on the back needle. (73 (83, 93) stitches total) 

If you worked a different height for the heel flap, on the back needle you will have 16 (18, 20) stitches + the number of stitches you picked up. The total stitch count will change accordingly.
