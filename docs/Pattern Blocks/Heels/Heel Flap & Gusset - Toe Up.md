# Heel

As you work the gusset and heel flap on the back needle, you will continue the instep pattern across the front needle.

## Gusset Increases

##### Round 1

Front needle: //instep pattern//

Back needle: M1L, k to end, M1R

##### Round 2

Front needle: //instep pattern//

Back needle: K to end

Repeat [Rounds 1 & 2] 11 (12, 14) more times 12 (13, 15) total). You will have 29 (33, 37) stitches on the front needle and 53 (59, 67) on the back needle (82 (92, 104) total).

The first 12 (13. 15) and last 12 (13, 15) stitches of the back needle are the gusset stitches. These will be on hold while you work the heel turn across the middle 29 (33, 37) stitches.

## Heel Turn

##### Setup Round

Front Needle: K2, k1tbl, p2, LT, p2, k1tbl, k to last 10 stitches, k1tbl, p2, LT, p2, k1tbl, k2

##### Short Rows

You will work the following rows on the back needle only.

Row 1: K to last 12 (13, 15) stitches, turn.

Row 2: MDS, p to last 12 (13, 15) stitches, turn.

Row 3: MDS, k to DS, turn.

Row 4: MDS, p to DS, turn.

Repeat [Rows 3 & 4] until 9 (11, 13) stitches are left between the double stitches. Do not turn after the last row (a Row 3).

###### Small Only

At this point you should have 12 gusset stitches, 10 double stitches, and 9 regular stitches on your right needle and 10 double stitches and 12 gusset stitches on your left needle (31 right, 22 left, 53 total).

###### Medium Only

At this point you should have 13 gusset stitches, 11 double stitches, and 11 regular stitches on your right needle and 11 double stitches and 13 gusset stitches on your left needle (35 right, 24 left, 59 total).

###### Large Only

At this point you should have 15 gusset stitches, 12 double stitches, and 13 regular stitches on your right needle and 12 double stitches and 15 gusset stitches on your left needle (40 right, 27 left, 67 total).

## Heel Flap

The heel flap is also worked across the back needle only until the very end. As you work through DS, knit and purl them as one stitch.

Row 1: K to last DS, ssk, turn. (The ssk combines the last DS with the first gusset stitch)

Row 2: Sl1p, p to last DS, p2tog, turn. (The p2tog combines the last DS with the first gusset stitch)

Row 3: Sl1p, k to slipped stitch, ssk, turn.

Row 4: Sl1p, p to slipped stitch, p2tog, turn.

Repeat [Rows 3 & 4] until only one gusset stitch is left on each side of the needle.

Back Needle: Sl1p, k to slipped stitch, ssk.

Front Needle: //instep pattern//

Back Needle (again): K2tog, k to end.
