n = total stitch count

# Leg or Foot
## Gusset Increases

As you work the gusset on the back needle, you will continue the instep pattern across the front needle.

##### Round 1

Front needle: //instep pattern//

Back needle: M1L, k to end, M1R

##### Round 2

Front needle: //instep pattern//

Back needle: K to end

Repeat [Rounds 1 & 2] 4 more times (5 total). You will have 0.5n stitches on the front needle and 0.5n+10 on the back needle (n+10 total).

# Shallower Heel

Knit across the stitches on your front needles. These are your instep stitches and will be on hold while you work the heel.

Knit across the first 5 stitches and also put them on hold.

If you’re working with a contrast color for the heel, switch to the CC now.

The heel is worked back and forth using the German Short Row method.

## Part 1

Row 1 (RS): Knit to the gusset stitches. Turn. (The 5 gusset stitches are now on hold.)

Row 2 (WS): MDS, p to the gusset stitches. Turn.

Row 3 (RS): MDS, k to next DS. Turn.

Row 4 (WS): MDS, p to next double stitch. Turn.

Repeat [Rows 3 & 4] until you have //math// stitches left between the double stitches. Stop at the end of a Row 3, but do not turn.

## Part 2

Setup (RS): Knit the double stitch as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Row 1 (WS): SL1P, p until next DS, p DS as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Row 2 (RS): SL1P, k until next DS, k DS as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Repeat [Rows 1 & 2] until all double stitches have been worked, ending after a Row 1.

Switch back to main color (if doing a contrast heel) and knit the gusset stitches until the end of the back needle.

# Deeper Heel

Knit across the stitches on your front needles. These are your instep stitches and will be on hold while you work the heel. You will work 8 of the 10 gusset stitches (4 on each side) and leave the outmost stitches on hold.

Knit the first stitch.

If you’re working with a contrast color for the heel, switch to the CC now.

The heel is worked back and forth using the German Short Row method.

## Part 1

Row 1 (RS): Knit to last stitch. Turn.

Row 2 (WS): MDS, p to last stitch. Turn.

Row 3 (RS): MDS, k to next DS. Turn.

Row 4 (WS): MDS, p to next double stitch. Turn.

Repeat [Rows 3 & 4] until you have //math// stitches left between the double stitches. Stop at the end of a Row 3, but do not turn.

## Part 2

Setup (RS): Knit the double stitch as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Row 1 (WS): SL1P, p until next DS, p DS as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Row 2 (RS): SL1P, k until next DS, k DS as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Repeat [Rows 1 & 2] until all double stitches have been worked, ending after a Row 1.

Switch back to main color (if doing a contrast heel) and knit until the end of the needle.

# Leg or Foot
