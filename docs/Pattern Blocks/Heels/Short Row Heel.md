# Heel

Knit across the stitches on your front needles. These are your instep stitches and will be on hold while you work the heel.

If you’re working with a contrast color for the heel, switch to the CC now.

The heel is worked back and forth using the German Short Row method.

## Part 1

Row 1 (RS): Knit to end of heel stitches. Turn. (27 stitches)

Row 2 (WS): MDS, p to end of heel stitches. Turn.

Row 3 (RS): MDS, k to next DS. Turn.

Row 4 (WS): MDS, p to next double stitch. Turn.

Repeat [Rows 3 & 4] until you have 9 stitches left between the double stitches. Stop at the end of a Row 3, but do not turn.

## Part 2

Setup (RS): Knit the double stitch as if it were one stitch. Turn.

Row 1 (WS): SL1P, p until next DS, p DS as if it were one stitch.

Row 2 (RS): SL1P, k until next DS, k DS as if it were one stitch.

Repeat [Rows 1 & 2] until all double stitches have been worked, ending after a Row 1.
