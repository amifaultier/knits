# Cuff

Cast on //math// stitches using a [[provisional cast on]]. I recommend either knitting a few rows with waste yarn or using a crochet provisional cast on. You can also cast-on using your preferred cast-on method and either pick up stitches along the edge when doing the fold-over cuff or sewing the cuff down later.

Join in the round - front needle will have 29 (33, 37) stitches, back needle will have 28 (32, 36) stitches.

Knit 8 rounds in stockinette stitch.

## Ankle Tab

Knit across the front needle.

You will now work a series of short rows across the back needle, with one complete round in the middle. Short row instructions are divided based on your starting stitch count.
