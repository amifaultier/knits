If you're knitting a contrast toe, using you CC, cast on //math// stitches per needle (//math// total) using [[Judyâ€™s Magic Cast-On]] (or alternative Toe-Up method). I recommend wrapping the first stitch around the needle instead of using a slipknot for a smoother appearance.  

Knit one round (and remember to knit the stitches on the back needle through the back loop).

The instructions below are for a rounded wedge toe. For a regular wedge toe, only work Part Two.

## Increases - Part One

Increase Round: * Kfb, k to last 2 stitches, kfb, k1*, repeat ** on back needle

Repeat [Increase Round] 3 more times, 4 times total.

## Increases - Part Two

Round 1: * Kfb, k to last 2 stitches, kfb, k1*, repeat ** on back needle

Round 2: Knit to end

Repeat [Rounds 1 & 2] until you have //math// stitches per needle (//math// total)

Knit 2 rounds.
